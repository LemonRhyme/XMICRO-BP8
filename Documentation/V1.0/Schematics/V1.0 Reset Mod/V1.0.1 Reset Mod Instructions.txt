2. 1x 10K resistor
3. 2x 22K resistor
4. 1x 470 resistor
5. 1x 220 resistor

Replacements
1. R8 - 22K
2. R9 - 22K
3. R10 - 470
4. R12 - 220

Modifications
1. R11 tied to +5VSB
2. Q2 Emitter to +3.3V
3. Q1 Collector 10K pullup to +5VSB
4. C56 diode to R9
5. U9 pin 3 connect to R9 though diode


Instructions
1. Cut traces on top and bottom connecting to R11 on the pad furthest from the LEDs. Connect wire on the bottom between this pad and the center pad of JP6.
2. Connect wire between Q2 Emitter pad (furthest from LEDs) and C1 (furthest pad from LEDs)
3. Connect a 10k resistor between JP5 and C54 pads closest to the board edge.
4. Connect the anode of a diode to C56 on the pad closest to C55, connect the cathode (negative) to R9 pad closest to the LEDs.
5. Cut trace between U9 pin 3 and R9. Connect the anode of a diode to U9 pin 3, connect the cathode (negative) to R9 pad closest to the LEDs.
