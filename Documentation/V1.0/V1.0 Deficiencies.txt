	C48 Polarity is reversed
	Power-on Reset is flaky.
		Hardware V1 fix is to tie R11 to +5VSB. This provides more stability when turning on.
		Later versions should be reworked so that RESET is held low at all times if PG signal is not high.
	Reset indicator LED was sometimes partially on when RESET was high. Added a 10k pullup to the base of Q2.
	Using 470R for R11 and 270R for R12.
	Ground pour can be tighter, but thermals should be embiggened.
	Probably a good idea to add some clamping diodes.
